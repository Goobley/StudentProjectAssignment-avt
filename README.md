# StudentProjectAssignment-avt

There are a number of algorithms that can be used to assign students to projects. Some of the most common algorithms include:


	
#####The Hungarian algorithm 
is a linear-time algorithm that can be used to find a stable matching between students and projects. A stable matching is one in which no student and project prefer each other to their current assignment.
	
###The auction algorithm 
is a heuristic algorithm that can be used to find a good solution to the student-project assignment problem. It is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but it is often very efficient.
	
###The greedy algorithm
is a simple algorithm that can be used to find a good solution to the student-project assignment problem. It is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but it is often very efficient.


##THE CHALLENGE

Write a script that will assign students to projects. The data is provided in the excel spreadsheet (attached). You want to optimise for all students receiving the highest priority project possible. I have the distribution of those receiving their first choice, second choice, etc. from the random assignment process, so that is your benchmark.

##CONSTRAINTS

The spreadsheet also contain a page with constraints on the number of students to be allocated to each project, not all are one, so be careful.

The spreadsheet also has which Section the project would be supervised in, this is something that should be monitored but it is not (at this point) an optimisation criteria.



##THE WINNER

The winner will be decided by who creates a program that generates the highest level of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. allocations.

In the event of a tie, bonus points will be awarded for bells and whistles, such as:


	
A self contained package that can read in data exported from the excel file and return data and statistics that are readable as an excel file (e.g., csv data) - or do it in VBA if you want!
	
If you can think of any exciting, humorous or useful additions to the ranking that are also implemented as required...

##THE PRIZE
FREE DRINKS following the SCoTCH Research Day and potentially acknowledgment and recognition from generations of students if you're script is taken forward and implemented as Departmental policy.
 
##DEADLINE: 
Submit entries (program and output) to TT 1 week before the SCoTCH research day so I can test and verify results. The winner will be announced on the day.... Happy coding
